In this course we will explore the world of Go, free, fast, easy to learn
language very similar to Python. We will be making basic chatbots â€“ programs
which will respond to what you write in chat.

This course is suitable for kids with some level of programming experience, such
as Python, Scratch or other language. Students should be familiar with basic
computer functions, such as downloading and opening files. There will be typing
involved. Before first class please have the following software installed

{{< download "Go" "https://go.dev/dl/" >}}
{{< download "Git" "https://git-scm.com/download" >}}
{{< download "Visual Studio Code" "https://code.visualstudio.com/">}}

Going over https://try.github.io would help you understand Git, which will be
using to save and share your code.
