Scratch is a programming language and an online community where children can program and share interactive media such as stories, games, and animation with people from all over the world. As children create with Scratch, they learn to think creatively, work collaboratively, and reason systematically.

While Scratch is primarily designed for 8 to 16 year olds, it is also used by people of all ages, including younger children with their parents.
