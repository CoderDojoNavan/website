## Prerequisites

Before coming to class, please download a text editor for editing your web
pages. We recommend Visual Studio Code. Standard Notepad can be used but it’s
better to get a text editor which uses different colours for different parts of
the code – it makes things much easier.

Also, we ask that you please download and install Google Chrome, as we’ll be
using its Developer Tools in this course.
