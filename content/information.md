CoderDojo Navan is a cool, free environment where kids can learn how to program,
build websites, animated characters and games with different software programs
and languages.

All the mentors are volunteers who either teach or work in IT, and our aim is to
help you develop the skills you want to learn.

We will now be holding our Dojo sessions for 6 consecutive Saturdays for a 2
hour session; 10.30am – 12.30pm each week, instead of once a month. The actual
times have been determined by the mentor leading each particular class.
Therefore some classes may have different times.

Given the volunteer nature of the Dojo, it is requested that those signing up
for a course, do so with the intention of attending all 6 Saturdays in
recognition of the time being given by our volunteer mentors. The students that
attend all dates will then be awarded a course completion certificate.

For all courses except ‘Scratch’, students should already be familiar with basic
computer functions such as downloading, opening files, saving information to
different locations and basic keyboard skills.

There will be limited spaces for each course. Our regulars and those on our
waiting list shall be contacted by email over the coming days with any available
places thereafter announced here.

The CoderDojo Parents’ Handbook is essential reading for any parent or guardian
who would like to know more about CoderDojo. The handbook provides an
introduction to the CoderDojo movement, an overview of coding and why it is such
a useful skill in today’s world, suggestions for getting involved at your local
CoderDojo club, advice on how to support your child’s learning journey, and much
more. [Click here to download a PDF of the Handbook][Handbook]

If you are interested in any taking part or if you are interested in mentoring
or offering your skills as a speaker to a class for a one off workshop on specialised software (such as Photoshop, Autocad, etc.) or hardware workshop,
please email us on coderdojonavan@gmail.com

## What you need to bring

1. Please bring a WIFI-enabled laptop, fully charged if possible.
2. If you’re  attending a Scratch class, please install the [latest version of Scratch][scratch] on your laptop.
3. It would be a good idea to bring a USB key to save your work.
4. For sprite-drawing we recommend you bring a pair of headphones and a mouse
   (even an old wired mouse) as the Paint Editor doesn’t suit a laptop mouse
   pad.
5. If you are new to CoderDojo Navan, you can pre-register as a member by
   downloading our registration form here, fill out and present it to a mentor
   when you arrive.
