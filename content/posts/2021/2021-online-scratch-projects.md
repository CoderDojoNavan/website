Due to the current  Covid restrictions, unfortunately we’re still not able to
run our normal face-to-face CoderDojo classes this year. In the meantime, we
have 1 Scratch project (Beginners or Advanced) we’d like you to attempt over
the next 2 weeks.

## Scratch Beginners

Rockband – https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band
Learn how to code your own musical instruments using scratch

## Scratch Advanced

Scratch the Cat goes Skiing – https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/scratch-cat-goes-skiing
A simple Scrolling game

This is open to everyone, even if you have never attended the CoderDojo classes
before.

If this is your first time using Scratch, please install Scratch on your
PC/laptop, if it is not there already – Scratch is free and can be downloaded
here: https://scratch.mit.edu/download

We would also advise, if you haven’t already done so, to sign up to Scratch so
that you can save your project directly onto the Scratch site.

We’re planning to post more projects/resources in the coming weeks, so please
check this website and our Facebook page for more details.

Happy Coding!
