Hello Parents.

Recently, some of the CoderDojo Navan team met online to discuss how and when we
might be able to resume the classes again. Unfortunately the Unity Centre still
has Covid restrictions in place and therefore it’s still not feasible to run any
classes there at this time.

Even on October 22nd (when some easing of restrictions will be announced), we’re
still unsure as to what impact this may have on the Unity Centre. Therefore we
have decided that we will try running the new season of classes in February
2022. Hopefully most restrictions will be eased then, allowing us to utilise
the rooms at nearer full capacity.

Before we start planning ahead, we would love to get your feedback and
suggestions for the next classes. Please can you complete the online survey for
all those Parents interested in starting/resuming their children in the classes.
